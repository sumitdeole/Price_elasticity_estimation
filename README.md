# Fulton fish market and the price elasticity of demand

## **The Why**
Price elasticities inform us how much a price increase (or decrease) will impact the demand for a product. With attractive price-setting forming an essential component of the growth strategy of e-commerce companies (Amazon, Zalando, BestSecret, etc.), a clean estimation of the price elasticities of their products is often considered vital for their existence. While these companies can easily employ valuable customer datasets for such an exercise, we will use a freely available dataset to revisit fundamental concepts.

Lets first quickly see why price elasticity matters?
Many goods we consume are considered elastic, i.e., their demand goes up (down) when their prices increase (decrease). For example, luxury clothing and electronics consumption often react to price changes and hence are price elastic. In contrast, the consumption of food/medicines does not respond to price changes, so it is considered price inelastic. Interestingly, not all consumer electronics are price elastic; e.g., consumer loyalty of iPhone users makes their demand price inelastic. This underscores the importance of giving special attention to separately estimating the price elasticities of different products.
